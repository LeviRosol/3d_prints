The scad_baseplates can be used to create your own baseplates for use with OpenForge tiles.

Within the file you will have options to control your grid rows and columns, as well as the cell size, wall height, spacing, and shelf size.

I am currently running test prints on an Ender 3 using PLA, and am using Orca as my slicer.

These are being printed without a raft.

Now that I have dialed in a functional baseplate, I am dialing in the model and subsequent print for speed, durability, and aesthetic.
